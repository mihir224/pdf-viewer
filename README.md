i# About
This is a pdf viewer I made using React.js. Here, I have used the react-pdf module to integrate any PDF file into the website. There are options to zoom-in and out of the document using the embedded Material-UI icons. 

## To Get Started
Clone the repositiory using: 
### `git clone https://github.com/mihir224/pdf-viewer`

In the project folder, run:
### `npm install`
to install the required packages

Then, run:
### `npm run dev`
to start both the express and react servers simultaneously and run the app locally
